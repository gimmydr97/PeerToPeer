the voting doblon, which is not useful anymore, is substituted with the candidate’s symbol.

Each candidate associates to themselves a personal public symbol that uniquely identifies
them, they create many copies that are sent to the homes of the citizens of Valadilène
together with their government plan. No wonder half of the plan is dedicated to how to
organize the Maxi-Delirium. During the election day, each voter puts inside their envelope,
together with their sigil and the soul, the symbol of the candidate they want to elect. The
decision is mainly driven by how cool and fun the next Maxi-Deliriums will be important the
plans to develop and improve Valadilène are.

Similar to the old mechanism, the envelopes are first collected and only afterwards opened
and counted by the counting council members. Moreover, those who voted for the losing
candidates get their soul back as a refund.

Generalize the smart contract of the final term. Instead of having a single
candidate who wins or loses, the contract keeps a list of candidates identified by their
symbol, i.e. the Ethereum address: the candidate who gets more soul (cryptocurrency)
associated with the votes wins; in case of two, or more, candidates receive the same soul,
the candidate with more votes wins; in case of an additional tie, no one wins.

The candidate list is passed to the smart contract at its creation (argument of the
constructor). After declaring the winner, all the soul associated with the users who voted for
the losing candidates receive their soul back; in case no one wins, all the soul go to the
escrow account.
